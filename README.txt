To REQUEST data from the microservice, write a capital D followed by a date in the format MM/DD in the trivia-service.txt file.

To RECIEVE data from the microservice, wait around 2-3 seconds, and then read the line in the trivia-service.txt file.
Be sure to remove the first character from the string, as it is a T to stop the microservice from confusing itself.
